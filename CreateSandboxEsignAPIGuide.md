Our Sandbox (Test) eSign API is an exact replica of our Production (Paid) eSign API. The only differences are:

- Our Sandbox (Test) eSign API is Free of Charge
- All Documents created via our Sandbox (Test) eSign API have a "TESTING" watermark
- You start with a pool of 25 Documents
- You can delete Documents to have them added back into your Document Pool
- You can request more Test Documents here: api@esigngenie.com

You can sign up for a [free trial](https://www.esigngenie.com/registration/) and request Sandbox (Testing) eSign API access by calling (408) 560-3900 or via our chat reps.
